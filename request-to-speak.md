# Call for Speakers

We host meetups each month on the second Thursday. A typical meetup has one 20-minute _feature_ talk and two 10-minute _lightning_ talks.

The speakers are folks just like you!

This is a great opportunity to share what you know with the community, meet new people, and impress your boss with your public-speaking skills.

## How it works

- Read the guidelines below.
- Submit a proposal via a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/seattlejs/seattlejs/issues/new) or contact the organizers on Slack (http://bit.ly/SeattleJSSlack). Please follow the [template](#talk-proposal-template).
- If you know you want to do a quicker presentation (~10 min) then add a _Lightning!_ tag to the issue.
- If the proposal sounds like something that will work for our members, we'll group the talk with similar proposals and schedule it.

*Why GH issues? It makes it easy for us to schedule things. If you'd rather not use issues - no biggie! Just head over to the #call-for-speakers channel on the SeattleJS Slack.*


## What makes a good talk?

Seattle.JS has over 4,000 members, but obviously not every one shows up for each meetup (eek! where would we put them?). The audience ranges from experienced engineers who remember Life Before Chrome to newbies writing their first event listener.

Since our community has such a broad range of experience and interests, there isn't a one-size-fits-all talk. We group proposals into similar themes for each meetup, and the folks that are interested in the topic will come out.

## What's in a proposal?

In your proposal, tell us about your talk and a little about you. If you have any additional materials, like a slide deck, site, or repo, please link to them. [Here's a template](#talk-proposal-template).

## Topics

We're always interested in:

*Edge:* What's coming up in the next version of browsers and new packages we should know about.

*Case studies:* Have you built something interesting? Demo the project and explain architectural and design decisions as well as problems you encountered.

*Tips & Tricks:* Do you have a unique workflow that you want to share? A handy library you've discovered?

*Cat GIFs:* no explanation required.

**Specific topics**

These are some interesting topics that might appeal to our community. If you don't see a topic that's interesting to you, let us know via the SeattleJS Slack group (http://bit.ly/SeattleJSslack)!

We're open to proposals on *any* topic related to JavaScript.

Here are a few to get you started:

- JavaScript and hardware: communicating over sockets (Leap, Arduino, etc.)

- Class War - approaches to writing classes, private and public properties, singletons, factories, and helpers.

- JavaScript and the rest of the world. Did you know there are other web platforms besides Node.js? The ins-and-outs of JS and Rails, Python, Go, etc.

- Creative Code - what can you do with JavaScript other than move text around?

- Task Runners - why you need them, what they do, and how to use them (Gulp, Grunt)

- Idiomatic.js - the right way to write JavaScript?

- Designing complex interfaces: modals, panels, flows. Managing application state and user context.

- Responsive design - what it means and how it works.

- Single Page Apps: architectural approaches and decisions.

- Performance: how to get the most out of JavaScript.

- Games - how to develop games with JavaScript.

- Mobile: what you can and can't do with JavaScript on mobile devices.

- The Case for (and against) JQuery.

- Why cat GIFs are the best thing ever.
